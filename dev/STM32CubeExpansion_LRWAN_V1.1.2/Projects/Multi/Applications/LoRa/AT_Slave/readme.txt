@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements an example of a LoRa
modem that is controlled though AT command interface over UART by an external host,
like a computer executing a terminal.

This application is targeting the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery board embedding the
CMWX1ZZABZ-091 LoRa module.

This application uses the Cube Low Layer drivers APIs targeting the STM32L0
(embedded in the module) to optimize the code size.

@par Hardware and Software environment 


  - This example runs on the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery board embedding the
    CMWX1ZZABZ-091 LoRa module, and has been tested with STMicroelectronics
    B-L072Z-LRWAN1 RevC board.

  - B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery board Set-up    
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to micro-B 
      to ST-LINK connector (CN7).
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector CN8 jumpers are fitted.
  -Set Up:

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Open a Terminal, connected the LoRa Object
  - UART Config = 9600, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control ( in src/vcom.c)
  - Terminal Config: Select 'CR+LF' for Transmit New-Line and switch 'Local echo' on
  - Send your AT commands by typing them in the terminal

@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a host AT_Master
application, featuring a complete set of AT commands to drive an external
LoRa modem.

The application provides a way to establish a LoRa Link, to read sensors
(temperature, humidity and pressure) and to transmit associated data to the
LoRa Network.

This application is targeting the NUCLEO-L053R8 board and uses the Cube Low
Layer drivers APIs targeting the STM32L0 (embedded in the module) to optimize
the code size.

@par Hardware and Software environment 


  - This example runs on the STM32L053R8 devices and has been tested with
    STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC board.

  - NUCLEO-L053R8 board Set-up 
    - When using MDM32L07X01 expansion board, plug the X_NUCLEO_IKS01A1 shield (sensors) 
    - Plug the  expansion board (I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1 or MDM32L07X01) on the NUCLEO-L053R8 board board   
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to micro-B 
      to ST-LINK connector (CN1).
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector CN2 jumpers are fitted.


  -Set Up:

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory (select the right workspace following the expansion board I_NUCLEO_LRWAN1 or MDM32L07X01)
  - Run the example
  - Note : If needed and in order to spy the communication between AT_MAster and LoRa modem 
    - Open an Hyperterminal Terminal and connect it (could be an FTDI cable) to the "D1:LPUART1_RX/D0:LPUART1_TX" of the LoRa Modem
    - UART Config = 115200, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control
    - Terminal Config: Select 'CR+LF' for Transmit New-Line and switch 'Local echo' on
